# Introduction 

The following is an analysis of the rent prices in Germany, specially for Land Brandenburg

I am interested in the behavior of rent prices for DÃ¼sseldorf and aim to answer the following questions:
1. How is rent price distribution in Land Brandenburg (Germany)?
2. Which city has the most expensive rent in Land Brandenburg (Germany)? or which city is the the cheapest?
3. What are the factors (such as rooms, balcony, parking space) which can influence on rent price in the most expensive city of Brandenburg? Look at closely
